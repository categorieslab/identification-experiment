    <p>We understand that as Amazon Turk Workers, your time is precious.</p>
    <p>Whether you are trying to earn a bit more cash or save for a future goal, sometimes the easiest, most tempting thing
       to do is speed through HITs and finish as many as possible.</p>
    <p>As we are a research lab relying on data from workers like you, we ask that you try your best in our experiment.</p>
    <p>We have found that most workers <i>do</i> put in effort, learn our task, and still finish in around 20 minutes.</p>
    <p>Please give this a go, like the majority of workers. It can actually be quite fun!</p>
    <p>Thanks so much.</p>

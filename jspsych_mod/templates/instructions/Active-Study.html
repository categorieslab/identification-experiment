    <p style="text:align:center">Welcome!</p>
    <p>In this experiment, you will learn to identify sixteen paintings by their newly assigned names.
      (To clarify, these names are not the paintings' actual names. Rather, they serve as placeholders
      for the purpose of this experiment.)</p>
    <p>You will first undergo a <b>training phase</b>. Your task is to determine the name of the paintings by
      pressing on the corresponding button on the screen. Before answering, you must wait half a second.
      Feedback will be given for each response.</p>
    <p>After the training phase, you will undergo a <b>testing phase</b>, where you will again identify
      each painting with its correponding name. However, feedback will not be given for each response.</p>
    <p>You will have unlimited time to respond to each painting. Please place your hand on the mouse and
      click the button to begin. Good luck!</p>
